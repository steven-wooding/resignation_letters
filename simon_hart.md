I had desperately hoped that I could avoid writing this letter, but alas there seems no other
option left but to step down from my role as Secretary of State for Wales.
You will be remembered as a Prime Minister with energy, vision, determination and humour.
There was never a dull moment as a Minister in your Government, and I will be forever grateful
to have been given the chance to be part of it.
I have never been a massive fan of Ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing
change. Colleagues have done their upmost in private and public to help you turn the ship
around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible.
Kind regards
Rt Hon Simon Hart MP
